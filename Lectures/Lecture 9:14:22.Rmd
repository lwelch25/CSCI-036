## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
example <- tribble(
  ~height, ~age, 
  120, 14,
  150, 16, 
  210, 25, 
)
```

```{r}
vgsales <- read_csv("vgsalesGlobalmod.csv", skip = 3, col_types = "d??d????")
```
```{r}
x <- c(10, 8, 12 ,17)
x >= c(9, 10, 11, 12)
```

```{r}
x >= c(13, 9)
```

Stay away from this formulation, even though it technically  "works" 

```{r}
vgsales |> 
  filter(Year >= 500)
```

Logical operators

Logical "AND" is TRUE if every boolean connected by logical "AND" are TRUE
/[
/textsf{T} /wedge  = /textsf{T}
/]

Logical "OR" is TRUE if at least one of the booleans connected is TRUE

NA (Not avaiblable)

NA is kind of contagious

Logcial "AND" and "OR" in R 

Logical "AND" symbol is '&' 

Vector Opoerations: 
  These comparisons , '==' , ' >=' , '>', '&' and '|' 
  are vector operations
  
What is we want for filter: 
  Non vector equivalents for logical "AND" and logical "OR" are '&&' and '||'. DONT USE THESE FOR FILTER

```{r}
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) & c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

  
For if and while statement you would use: 
```{r}
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) && c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```
